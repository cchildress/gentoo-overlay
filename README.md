This is an overlay I created to bundle my additions to the Gentoo portage tree.

This overlay contains ebuilds to help build Gentoo with support for SCST. This allows the system to act as a SCSI target.
Currently I am only working on making iSCSI available. If you would like to help with FC or FCoE please feel free to contact me.
More information on the SCST project can be found here:
http://scst.sourceforge.net/
The SCST related packages are currently not fully tested. I am still working on getting a small QA pod put together, but until then you may want to double check my work before you run it.
